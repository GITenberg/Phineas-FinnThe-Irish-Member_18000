description: "Phineas Finn is a novel by Anthony Trollope and the name of its leading\
  \ character. The novel was first published as a monthly serial from October 1867\
  \ to May 1868 in St Paul's Magazine. It is the second of the \"Palliser\" series\
  \ of novels. Its sequel, Phineas Redux, is the fourth novel in the series.\nIt deals\
  \ with both British parliamentary politics of the 1860s, including voting reform\
  \ (secret ballot and eliminating rotten boroughs and Irish tenant-right) and Finn's\
  \ romances with women of fortune, which would secure his financial future.\n From\
